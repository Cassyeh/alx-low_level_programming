# ALX Low Level Programming for C Projects
This repository was created during the duration I was enrolled in the alx SE program and learning C language.
During the course of this period, a number of directories were created which demonstrate aspects and concepts in C programming such as Variables, if, else, while  functions, nested loops, pointers, arrays, recursion, dynamic memory allocation, variadic functions and so on.
Files were created in these directories to show understanding of topics touched and also to recreate popular functions found in the C standard library such as _strcpy, _printf and so on.

### Environment
* Language: C
* OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Compiler: gcc 4.8.4
* Style guidelines: [Betty style](https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty/wiki)
